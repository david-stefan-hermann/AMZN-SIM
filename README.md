# AMZN-SIM
This is a harmless simulation of the life of a warehouse worker of an imaginary online reseller.

## Workflow
1. Read into recommended file structure for a Unity project.
2. Coming up with an idea for the games concept.
3. Creating a proof of concept using ChatGPT.
   > I want to create a Unity 3D desktop game. IT is name AMZN-SIM, short for ****** simulator. The game level will be two rooms, connected by a door. one is the workplace and the other room is the home. the player is a 3d character that can move, and pick up and place. the workplace consists of a package conveyor belt, which moves a constant flow of packages. the player earns money by picking up damaged packages from the conveyor belt and throwing them into a bin. there are three npcs, two are working at the belt and one is an overseer, who  whips the player if they miss a damaged package. the workplace also has two buttons, one for "start working" and one "stop working". If the player enters the home, the state "stop working" will automatically disabled. during this state, the player will not be hurt by the overseer. In the player home, there is a PC, where the player can access the internet and purchase home decorations from amazon. Once purchased, the pop up in predefined spots in the home. Write the correct controllers and everything else for this project.
